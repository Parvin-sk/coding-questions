your provided with a string which has a sequence of 0's and 1's.this sequence is encoded version of english word.you are supposed to write a program to decode the provided string and find the original word A:1,B:11,C:111 and z will have 26 1's the sequence of 1's in the encoded form are separated by single 0 which helps to distinguish between 2 letters example:10110111 Ans:ABC give me java code with the approch of using Ascii value where we initialize a count variable to 0 and when 1 occurs count increases and and number of 1's is added to the value 64 and retuns the output . give a java code where a method gives answer to the main meyhod
